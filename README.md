# EasyShop
To reduce the billing queues in big grocery Stores &amp; Malls

# Problem Staement
Whenever we go to grocery store we find there is always rush and long queue at payemt counters and due to this we get irritated as queue is always long.

# Solution Recommended
There should be mobile integrated billing platform where mobile billing app connected to the store's central payment system at the user-end that can scan bar codes of product ID and the product info is stored & retrieved from the database and this way the bill can be dynamically generated on the user-end and can be customized by him as well. As soon as customer reaches to pay counter he just have to pay directly without waiting as the billing time is utilized by the users instead of the billing personnel on the counter generating the bill for all the items of the foremost person in the queue. The shopping bill may be verified at the store counter or by any other designated store personnel, thereby allowing some customers to utilize the slack time rather than waiting in a queue, and reducing the queue lenthy henceforth.

# Project Brief 
This is an Android App through which a user can scan whatever product he likes at grocery store and their product will be added to a billing ID created at that time only and through that he can pay for that bill without any time loss. Payment feature may be included but it is at the sole discretion of the store which adapts EasyShop, and its an optional module for allowing users to complete the payment (in the app after generating bill) through different e-payment methods like Credit/Debit Card, Internet Banking, Mobile Banking, e-Wallets etc.

# Software tools used
Android Studio, Emulator, Android Lollipop v5.1 mobile were used for building this App.
